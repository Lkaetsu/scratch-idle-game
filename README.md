# Scratch-idle-game

- ### Description:
    Little idle game made with scratch for CS50 - Introduction to computer science problem set 0

- ### How it works:
  - There is no especific objective, just a lemonade stand and some buttons to buy upgrades. To initialize the game click on the start flag;
  - There are currently three sprites you can interact with by clicking, the stand itself, the improve click button and the attendant button;
  - Clicking on the stand increases the amount of money by the amount indicated in the money-per-click variable;
  - Clicking on the improve click button, if you have the enough money to buy the upgrade, slighty increases the money-per-click variable;
  - Clicking on the attendant button, also only if you have the money for it, increases the passive money-per-second variable.
